# math-game
My first multi-file console application and first time using the solution explorer in Visual studio. 

# Requirements:
- [x] You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
- [x] The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100.
- [x] Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
- [x] You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
- [x] You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.

# Features:
* Console based user interface

# Challenges:
- This was my first time creating multiple files that would communicate with each other in C#, so I spent a lot of time analysing exactly what I was doing and how the classes and functions interacted with one another, learning as I went along. 
- A lot of the time my initial code was messy and made things quite hard to understand, but with some pointers I eventually got a bit more organised.
